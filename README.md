Create and setup a Catkin Workspace
--------------------------------

A catkin (ROS) workspace is a directory in which you can create or modify existing catkin packages. We will label our catkin workspace `catkin_ws`. To create the catkin workspace, type the following commands in the Terminal:

```bash
mkdir catkin_ws
cd catkin_ws
mkdir src
catkin_make
```

This will allow us to create a new folder in the home directory called `catkin_ws` by using the `mkdir` command. Then we create a source `src` folder inside the catkin workspace folder. Once done, make sure to use the command `catkin_make` inside the `catkin_ws` folder in order to init the catkin workspace. If you view your current directory contents, you should now have the `devel` and `build` folders. Inside the `devel` folder there are now several `setup.*sh` files. 

Then, we will need to source the `setup.bash` file to overlay this workspace on top of our ROS environment. In order to do this, it is necessary to go back in your home directory with the `cd` command and then type:

```bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Remember to add this source command to your `.bashrc` file under the source line of the global ROS installation. This is important so as to use your code with ROS functionalities. In order to access the `.bashrc` file type the following command:

```bash
gedit ~/.bashrc
```

How to run the simulation

Finally, run the whole project by running the launch file:

```bash
roslaunch lab_assignment_2 assignment.launch
```
